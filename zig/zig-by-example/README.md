# Zig By Example

Learn Zig by simple and small projects.

The original code was written for older Zig version (may below 0.9.1).

I'm using latest Zig version (master/0.10.0-dev.3414+4c750016e). Some code
examples are broken due to that. I have fixed the broken examples and tested
with this version.
## Run Example

Compile executable and run immediately.

```sh
$ zig run [program_name.zig]
```
