# A Monorepo of My Experiments

**tl;dr**: various experimental stuffs.

## Introduction

This repository contains pieces of code that I want to have, but don't deserve their own repository.

It's a collection of little snippets of programs I write when I test out ideas. Many are written quickly and off the cuff.

Some of these are mostly snippets of random code from small projects, experiments and some courses. This is also a place to keep those "Hello World" and basic examples.

This gives a kind of rough idea of how much I know about a given language, library or framework. They're not complete.

## Structure

I've organized the snippets by language, library or framework, each having its own directory. The title of each file should give a clue about its purpose. Keep in mind, however, that some of these are written quickly and aren't necessarily well documented. _They're "prototype" or "experimental" code._

## Disclaimer

I make no guarantee of any of this code functioning or serving any specific need. _I do try to mark code that doesn't work, though._ These programs are here primarily for educational or reference value.

That being said, I do hope you find them useful. _I'd love to hear from you if so._
