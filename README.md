# Experiments Repository

## Introduction

This repository is a collection of little snippets of code that are incomplete and too small to have their own repository, which is the reason I stored them all in one directory.

Some of these are mostly snippets of random code from small projects or experiments. I also use this repository as storage for basic examples like “Hello World”.

Even though they are not complete, this repository should provide a rough idea of how much I know about a given language, library, or framework.

## Structure

I've organized the snippets by language, library, or framework, each having its own directory. The title of each file should give a clue about its purpose. Keep in mind, however, that some of these are written quickly and aren't necessarily well documented. They're "prototype" or "experimental" code.

## Disclaimer

I take no guarantee of any of this code functioning or serving any specific need. I do try to mark code that doesn't work, though. These programs are here primarily for educational or reference value.

I do hope you find them useful. I'd love to hear from you if so.
